 They have to make this work .
 And that 's just where it 's at .
 We would still like it to work out .
Then get back to work .
 Is that one there ?
 We are just going day by day .
Is he or is nt he ?
It 's part of me now .
 Will you take her back ?
It 's up to people if they want to get into it .
 This is what you did back then .
Now , he has us .
She does nt like it .
And what did they want from me ?
That 's what we said .
But some do not .
But it 's good for him to go .
There 's no other high than that .
 You can see it on the court .
Here we do nt even get to do that .
What could be more political ?
She is just like them .
It 's been there a long , long time .
I go every year .
 He said ,  Then we are not going .
The show was over .
 I just like them .
 I would say it did ,  he said .
 But not like it was then .
  That could be me .
But this is what I do .
Just up , for now .
But where did they come from ?
You do not know who you are .
 I was ,   I said .
 But now , after going back to center , it 's where I want to be .
But then he did so .
Police were all around .
 I know I still can play .
 You are in a war .
It was a big family .
 Some come here to make money , some to play .
He was here with me .
 Which one are you ?
 It 's how we play .
What is it about them ?
But what would it say ?
  We were going to be family .
 I do nt know ,   I say .
 I did nt make us that way .
The last team at the end of the season .
 We can do that with the program here .
 And on and on .
But they say ,  So what ?
For me , too .
It just did nt work out for us .
I was never where I should be .
After that , it 's like any other game .
   They all know how to get there .
My Life at The New York Times .
 And he said he would have to take it home and think about it .
 He could get four or five years ,   he said .
 And there 's not much we can do about it .
Where are you going to show it ?
 Well , what do you want ?
 The public has the right to know .
 And during the war ?
 I will say no more about them .
 I never get down .
 It 's about people .
 There 's no way around it .
Here , some are over in two .
 I think them through .
 I could not think ,   he said today .
 No one can say .
I think you are going to go all the way .
And we will do so .
Then she had three children .
 They are children .
What might he say to him ?
It 's just not the same .
 This year , it 's ,  If , if , if .
 You never know when it 's going to end .
And he 's American .
They know if I do this , I get what I want .
 What about these ?
Where does one go from there ?
Then what are they ?
And that 's what we are going to do .
 That would be about me , then .
 My life is so good right now .
It would nt be what most of the people are about .
And they have a good time .
I used to think I was the only one .
They may have been right about her ,   she said .
Should I not use it ?
It 's the only way out .
