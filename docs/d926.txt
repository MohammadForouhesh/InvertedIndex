 It 's not what ?
Which End Is Up ?
How long is the American people -- will the American people put up with that ?
I do nt want to do business .
 I said how ?
ALL RIGHT , CHILDREN .
Now , you can not do business with them .
He said they could be a family .
He has only two .
Might have been , might have been .
 It 's still up to me .
I just do nt know how I would do that .
That 's just a part of what we do .
I said ,  Come with me .
Who are the people who go there ?
 It does nt take that much money .
You are part of it .
 How does he know that ?
I was that man .
 We know that it 's a long season .
I come to do work .
 They did nt know it was going on .
Or most of it .
 That used to be our life ,   she said .
Do nt come back here .
  He then put on the President of the United States .
Then I see her .
 Because without her we would nt have it .
I own a home .
 Who do you think you are ?
We are all one people .
How can I set this up ?
 We did nt want it to come down when it did .
I just could nt see it all .
It 's been all about the team .
It 's a part of the family .
But now they are a little less so .
  Is this them ?
 And he made it .
 Back on the left ,   she says .
 I have a long way to go ,   he said .
There is nt much to them until you get to know them .
 And what might that be ?
How does she know ?
  I think not .
 I do nt know where he 's at .
And we still have them .
 That 's too long .
You have to get to know each other .
 They never see one .
What do you say to this ?
 And he said ,  What ?
 This is my week off .
 It 's going well ,  she says .
 Then what do you want ?
 Now it 's out .
 What do I think of it now ?
 And we are going to put it through .
He may be some day .
He was out of time .
 My life is good .
But it has them .
 See what I did ?
   You were there ?
That 's what it has come down to .
What 's he called ?
Still , this is not the end of the show .
And that is all to the good .
But it is nt us .
 You are left with , what was it ?
It was a year ago , a long time .
 It 's part of me .
But I know this is a business .
 What do you think -- down ,   he said .
So what is the world to do ?
I do nt have a home .
 What does this say ?
 It has no life .
You did nt like them ?
But not to you ?
HOW TO DO IT ?
In a way , it may be .
 There 's no man in my life right now ,   she said .
 We see them and we do nt know much about them ,   he said .
 I go because it 's a show ,  she said .
  That night , she called me .
 They said ,  Well , you have nt been there in a few years .
There 's no market for them .
But , can they do it ?
I do nt know what that says about me .
The business will go on , he said .
 She said :  I did it .
 But we just did nt do it .
  As it should .
But it would nt be a home then .
 It 's a public school .
And how many might that be ?
