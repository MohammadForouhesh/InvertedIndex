You should just get them out of there .
That 's what I was here for .
The company did that as well .
I say ,  Do nt say no to me .
 He said ,  What do you think ?
There is only one New York .
It 's money , money , money .
 We just take it one game at a time .
It is time to do so .
 Still , they are all white .
 You want me up here so you can see me ?
Still , so what ?
I see some people and I know they will not like it .
We can not have it all .
That 's what they used to do .
She did nt last long .
 There Is No  I  in Team .
They want to get out on their own .
 How the people come in , how they go out .
And they have every right to be .
He 's going to be very big there .
This is not about being big ; this is about being good .
   I would nt ?
 They will be here in two or three years .
I want people to get home .
And they did nt want to come home without it .
There is also much to think about .
All day long , too , and all year long .
And she was nt like that .
Not that she has much time .
The street had called him .
 Just about every game .
What to do , what to do .
I know how much you make .
No one in his family had .
 That 's the next one ,   he called out .
I did nt know where I was going to be a year from then .
Even when it 's not ?
But he did nt show up .
It was one , not two .
 He can play , man .
 All old ,   she said .
 It is the same with us .
 And she just did it .
 That 's what it was like in the old days .
 It 's a part .
 It was very big and very old ,   he said the other day .
 It does nt take much ,   she said .
How long have they been there ?
New York has said no way .
He was not a little man .
And where does that put me ?
And go on they have .
Well , are they ?
How come it has nt ?
 I did nt make that public , but I did it .
What do women do now ?
Still , we do it .
He called and said he had to get back .
Get them while they last .
I do nt play .
And then I do nt go back for years .
Or a year after that .
It was just the way it was .
We may see that case made .
But they should have .
What do you put in it ?
There was much more .
There was another show every day .
 She was the first director I had .
Have to take it one day at a time from here on out .
 I can ,  she said .
On some days , they do three each .
And use them he did .
I just want it to go one way or the other .
I take what I can get .
But how could she ?
 Two go out and more come in .
This is not the first time they have been out of work , and it will not be the last .
It was nt too good .
That 's where we want our money to go .
 They should do very , very well .
And the week was still not over .
 Is she with the city ?
There is no street like this in New York .
One would think it was over .
And he said ,  I do nt know .
My children and I are not going the same way .
 I just do nt like him .
But , they are all over .
 You are so good to me .
That you do nt know .
That 's all these people do .
 It 's like another country .
And a good one .
 We just have to take it week to week , game to game .
But who 's to say I could nt ?
