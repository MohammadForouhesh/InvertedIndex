 She is so little .
 Where 's that money ?
Play in it , have a good time in it .
 You work for them .
After that , they can go home .
 There is nt much to see , is there ?
 That is good ,   he said .
But I do it every day .
 It was very , very big .
We are a good school .
How are we going to do it ?
He says it 's a school night .
 No , it 's not so much that ,   he said .
Time is not with us .
  This is not the case .
And there are many here like me .
I did nt have that much .
 Last Time Around ?
 It will make money .
This is what it 's all about .
I did not like it .
Take them up on this .
 One at a time .
 My life ,   she said .
 They are still here .
How come you did nt get them ?
 You know this one ?
These are nt just people .
Get over it , people .
They are in a war .
Where can it go ?
We made so much money .
He 's a team man all the way .
 You go there , and it 's like you never left here .
They  we ) are not .
 We have to take it one day at a time .
What does he want to be ?
   Your children should be in school .
They are part of a team .
But they make money .
But we did what we did .
We do nt think about them .
What was I going to play ?
It had to be my way .
 She could do that , but she does nt .
Get one while you still can .
Where the money is , we do nt know .
It 's like one of my children .
Because that is what she did .
 But is it ?
He was , too .
 Very many of them ,   he said .
 They did nt want to think .
 How do you make them ?
At the end of the day , who is nt ?
 Do you have these ?
You do nt even think , you just do it .
What do we all do ?
But is that what we want ?
I still go out .
 What 's he get ?
  I say :  I do nt .
 That 's what I think of this .
So get at it .
And she can play .
 But where is she ?
What 's in it for us ?
What should we think ?
 Where There 's Money .
I did nt say this to her , but it could .
Where is this program going on ?
What more could we want ?
 I did nt even think about that ,  he said yesterday .
What do they know that we do nt ?
It does nt make them the best .
But this is nt like that .
Only you do nt .
You see what you like and what you do nt like .
Well , it 's not .
Today was my first day with the team .
 Are you all right ?
But it 's too much .
You do nt know me .
 The public may never come back in .
 Day by day ,   he said ,  I see it going down .
 We have all been through too much ,   she said .
I would only see one every other year .
This is my game .
 As if I was nt there ,   he said .
We have a long way to go .
 I did nt want to be here .
But there is another .
 This used to be a united country ,   he said .
 I know , I know ,   I said .
But can I say any more than that ?
But some people like it this way .
 Now that they are out there , what can you do ?
