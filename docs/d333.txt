 That 's what I would like .
 This just is nt the right place for it ,   he said .
We are so used to it .
 So it 's we like where we are right now .
He used to do it all the time .
 That 's it ,   said another .
 But few people do .
 That is all over ,   he said .
What do you like about your work ?
I do nt have time .
And it 's every day - several big .
But what about a year or two from now ?
Or is it less with more ?
It 's new to me , too .
 If they take it , they take it ,  she said .
Not many at all .
We would like to work with them .
Then you are on your own .
 She is there for me .
 What do you do all day ?
You could make money .
Like , what is left ?
How would we get there ?
 I was at the right place at the right time .
 I think I did good today .
He may not be the same all season .
 How long are we going to play like this ?
 When you know what you want , you are going to get it .
What would he say to me ?
But that is not how people here think .
And he had to use his own money to do it .
And this is how it has to be .
 It 's been me , me , me .
 They have as much right to be here as we do .
Well , it 's still here .
It has to be very white .
And how to think .
Now I do nt want to go home .
 We were one of them .
He says ,  How many do you have ?
A family is no more .
Then it does nt work very well .
 How can it be so little ?
How did I end up like this ?
She was not about to say no .
 I did my best , they do their best .
 I said :  That 's it .
 I will never have more than two children ,   she said .
Not one 's life .
Take a show like this .
But you have to do what you have to do .
For many of them , it was not the first time .
 You know what I like most about it ?
 I think this is going to make money ,  he said .
 And it 's just not like that .
We did nt even know what it was .
And what do you have ?
 And you know what ?
But they had been used .
Get him back here .
 What , you did nt like it ?
And if so , when ?
We would nt know .
But what has come over them ?
You have to want to do it .
Our country is at war .
And how much was that ?
They had five days off .
  But it could not .
Because it is them who did this , not me .
What more can we do ?
It is time to go .
For a while times were good .
They play with us .
We do nt want you here .
 I do nt think it did ; it just could nt .
I think , Is this right ?
He will never be home .
Then , go on from there .
 I have a family to go home to ,  he said .
Now , we can get down to business .
First place is still first place .
But not New York .
 What are we left with ?
We were like a family .
 But if I had to , I can .
Did he get there ?
 Who do you think made out ?
It 's us against the world .
And we are going to go after it .
 But I think I like women .
 I just would like to get home .
 We just take it day by day .
 You are one , too .
 All he did was work and go to school .
 Where does he think they are going to go ?
What would you say to those people ?
