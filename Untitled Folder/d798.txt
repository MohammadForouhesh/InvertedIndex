 We were nt out there .
And well she might .
 I did nt know where we were going .
  And just like that , we are back .
 I have children ,   the man said .
No one could say how long it would take .
But that 's just how it is .
So it could be two people ?
But Which Team Is the Home Team ?
What would they be ?
And these are not good times .
That is nt the way it used to be .
 What do they say ?
 This is what we are going to do .
And I did nt make it .
 I think I did .
The people do nt like it , and you are not good at it .
 How high do you have to go ?
 He said it up and down .
 We are well on our way .
She does nt know how she 's going to do it .
 It 's all right ,   I said .
It is not their business .
 Not now , though .
  He did it all .
In the first game ?
 I think he was here yesterday .
 But I do nt see it like that .
What I do , they do nt .
It does nt work , it does nt work .
  People who work with her  know that I may go off ,   she said .
 How did they do that ?
He has , after all , been there before .
 That 's not good .
They go out and do them .
  Or :  I do nt see where you are going with this .
And what were they like ?
So what 's he to do ?
 Women have to work .
 It had been too long .
 At the end of the day , it is my house .
Do I go left or right ?
 But ,   he said ,  I just get on with it .
 They are out of school .
And for how long ?
What about my life ?
 It 's a home , not a house .
 That 's not new money ,   he said .
That time  did nt last too long ,   she said .
But if they do , we do nt know about it .
The game will never be what it used to be .
There just is nt any .
It 's against the law in New York .
For what would he say ?
But this is part of me .
   Who says we did nt ?
 It was just one of those days ,   she said .
 And I did nt do it .
And they were all going around each other to him , and that 's not the way it should be .
 We do nt get to .
Well , first of all , people see me .
He did not have a good time .
It says it all .
 You are the what ?
 But that 's three .
We do nt do business this way .
The world was against us during the war .
That 's just the way of the world .
Or he may not .
Are nt you an American ?
Get me out there .
She said very little .
 I would nt want to go back to the way it was .
 You have a million people there .
 They are all good .
They were nt all white .
But you know you are going to get the other end of it , too .
And he might still be .
And I do nt know .
We like our team .
 I was in the States .
Not every day is a down day .
This time around , it was all about business .
Come on over here .
That 's not part of our life .
They know it , and so do we .
It may now have to back down .
 People have said they are not the same , he said .
That 's what I used to think .
 They were very good to me as people .
 So you go with them .
 And that was some time ago .
What had they left ?
 I could not -- it was just too much .
I know you are still with me .
But it is not for play .
 And we did that .
