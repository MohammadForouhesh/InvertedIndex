 People did nt like it .
 Every day I come ,  he said .
I can still make the case , though .
 Just do nt take me to court .
 So much is going on .
 Then where are they ?
   I do nt much like that .
He did that and more .
Both have been at it for more than a year .
 It 's time to get to work .
It 's been a long season .
They are up to it .
It 's just go out there and be who you are .
The state says it did the best it could .
 The State Department did nt know it .
It 's a long life .
Well , he can have his money .
To me , they did .
But there 's more .
  But , last night , he did .
They do what they have to do .
We are a team here .
 That 's business ,   he said .
It might be our season .
But I want to go back .
 That I can not do .
 You want to play with the best .
 She said we all have to make our own way .
The Government should too .
 No place like home .
I had to get back to that .
What to do with them ?
After or before work ?
That 's so what .
 It 's never over with .
And how long will it take ?
What if each team were to get three or four million ?
Who does he think he is , and who does he think we are ?
  Or is it ?
 You do nt like me ?
In a public place ?
I did nt want to see it all .
Life is not over .
I do nt think most people do .
 We did nt think they would all come out .
 That I will now do .
There were too many , she said .
  That was good .
 But she does nt have to be .
Was all this about me ?
And she did and I was and it did and I did .
It 's just there every day .
His police would do that , he said .
 If you think you are nt going to make it , you are nt going to make it ,   he said .
 And if it was nt , then I would nt go over .
What in the world was this ?
 And he was nt .
 There is no way out of this .
 She said ,  I can .
 How much does the president make ?
You have to make a there there .
He is here in so many of you .
It 's not so much what he says as how he says it .
And it is nt like that at all .
 He called me first ,   he said .
 Two Years or Three ?
   I know , I know .
 First , they did nt want us , then they did want us , then they did nt know what to do with us .
This week it is .
 That 's old school ,   he said .
We have to come and play the game .
 He was there for business .
 Did these people come to see you ?
There was nt much work .
It is not for me to say .
I will put him in school .
 We do nt want to get any more of this .
 Well , this is what it 's all about .
 He 's been around a long time .
Very , very few .
 You never know what he 's going to do .
Now go out and do it .
We do nt want them around .
 What do nt we know ?
You want a little more .
We are all women .
I have nt been back since .
There it is , right there .
 What would I say to him now ?
Two more days off .
 They called , did nt they ?
They just were nt going down .
I work at home .
Should I be good ?
We are all united .
But he was not one of them .
I had no place to go .
